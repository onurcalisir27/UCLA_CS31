# Project 1: Debugging and Error Analysis

This project focuses on learning debugging techniques by analyzing C++ code with intentional errors. Students are tasked with identifying syntax and logic errors, understanding their causes, and fixing them.

## Objectives
- Understand the difference between syntax and logic errors.
- Learn to use error messages and debugging tools effectively.
- Develop problem-solving skills in debugging C++ programs.

## Files
- **original.cpp**: A correct implementation for reference.
- **logic_error.cpp**: Contains a logic error to debug.
- **compile_error.cpp**: Contains a syntax error to resolve.
- **report.txt**: Explanation of the errors and fixes applied.

## Skills Developed
- Debugging and troubleshooting in C++.
- Problem analysis and critical thinking.
- Working with error messages and compiler diagnostics.
